He consistently refers to higher level concepts as though students should already be familiar with them. iClicker questions often assume students know more than they do. Content is very specific and more focused on memorization than understanding concepts.",

    "comment": "Wonderful guy.  Very nice guy.   If you don't like surprises, don't take him is my advice.  He does try to trick you on exams, he will tell you he likes to challenge you on the exams.   It also takes him a long time to get things graded.  This is okay when you have large classes, but our class was very small and we were taking our first big exam before we knew what we got on our quizzes so you didn't know where you were for weeks at a time.  I really enjoyed him as a professor overall but you will find yourself frustrated at times because he adds concepts to quizzes and tests that he didn't cover in class all that thoroughly or that the homework didn't cover.  This only bothered me because he claims he follows homework when he makes his exams out but he adds concepts that the homework didn't cover, at all. Or he adds items to exams that he BARELY goes over in class.  If you are someone who needs practice and lots of examples in homework to practice & study, him adding concepts to tests that he barely went over, you will struggle.  My advice is to work problems from each section, even the ones he says you don't need,  because he will add stuff.  For example, when we covered even and odd functions, telling if a function is even or odd, etc, the homework doesn't cover those things but he added it to our 2nd exam.  So when you go over a study guide for the exam, he will add things and your like, \"Ummmm our homework didn't cover this,\" so then you basically have to learn new concepts at all once.  Also, when we covered trig functions, he added coterminals to the quiz and that was no where in the section we were being quizzed on so you basically have no real way of studying for his quizzes or exams when he does tricks like this.  I'm doing very well in the course, but him consistently doing this, it got so tiring and frustrating toward finals time.  I feel exhausted because you never know what to expect from his tests.  I think he assumes we are all math experts and know all of this math so studying can be so exhausting when he throws things in without warning us or preparing us adequately.  I never even heard the term coterminal in his class and yet we were quizzed on it, so be warned.",

Understanding students is like his superpower. Very non-judgemental and open-minded, so you always have a shot for a good grade (unlike with some other NKU profs).",

He cont to say that on avg BOTH classes were 40 pts lower than last semester, saying we didn't study enough it was our faults. Something tells me if both classes failed it's not us it's YOU!",

Two reasons: 1. she uses course compass its an online homework system, normally there are about 10-20 questions and it has a show me button that shows you how to work the problem.. 2. Ms. T works hard to help her students pass.. I once spent 3 hours at starbucks with her working homework.. She is dedicated to students.. Rcvd A",

You literally have to master the subject matter. P.S. Not everyone is here to be a math major lady.  Oh and literally hours upon hours of homework for a five week summer course.

It is a waste of her time and yours if you will just be on your phone. She gives us her number and loves when we text her questions and asking for explanation. Definitely would take her again. Like others have said, she is a mom",

Quizzes every week on material BEFORE his lecture on it, and  he refuses to let you see what you missed. Not much to learn from the labs, and most are in groups. He relies to heavily on the textbook. No extra credit. Expect to teach yourself. Avoid!",

He's a hard teacher, uses a ton of terminology (which isn't bad if you read), & the content is dry, but he REALLY cares about his students, especially if you participate. Joe went above and beyond when I needed a recommendation for a job. Great for networking",
